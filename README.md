# MCP Evidence Producers — Trivy + OSV Incubation

Scanner-specific producers for `mcp-evidence-gate`.

The repository was created for the Trivy producer and still preserves that
implementation. P2-002B incubates a second, logically independent OSV-Scanner
producer here. P2-004 adds an OCI image identity adapter around Trivy while
keeping registry resolution out of Core.

All producer modes map evidence to the pinned
`registry-pr-1404@20747d3253ba8638161dd95f1cec70df02993c22` receipt profile.
They do not claim server safety, provenance/name custody, cryptographic
attestation, signatures, PKI, scanner reputation, or Registry adoption.
Admission remains the downstream gate's job.

## Trivy — exact local file

```powershell
python -m pytest -q
python -m src.producer --trivy .\vendor\trivy.exe --artifact .\artifacts\requirements.txt --out .\out
```

This mode writes `trivy.raw.json`, `trivy.stderr.log`, `evidence.json`, and
`receipt.json`. The receipt binds the exact local artifact bytes.

## Trivy — exact OCI platform manifest

P2-004 treats an OCI image index and its platform image manifest as distinct
content-addressed objects. A real OCI scan must start from an immutable digest
reference; a tag is rejected by `src.oci_producer` rather than silently treated
as immutable identity.

For an image index, the resolver selects exactly one requested platform
descriptor, verifies the descriptor digest, size and media type, fetches the
selected image manifest, verifies the registry digest against the exact response
bytes, and invokes Trivy against the selected manifest digest:

```text
repo@root-index-digest
  -> exact platform descriptor
  -> repo@platform-manifest-digest
  -> trivy image repo@platform-manifest-digest
```

Example:

```bash
python -m src.oci_producer \
  --trivy ./trivy \
  --image ghcr.io/containers/kubernetes-mcp-server@sha256:7cba55569933e79d8b877607a0413c62faa23f0b281a99144ebb07f853539c82 \
  --platform-os linux \
  --platform-arch amd64 \
  --out out-oci
```

The producer retains:

- `oci-identity.json` — project-defined root-to-platform resolution record;
- `oci.index.json` — exact root index bytes when the root is an index;
- `oci.manifest.json` — exact selected platform manifest bytes;
- `trivy.raw.json` and `trivy.stderr.log`;
- `evidence.json` and `receipt.json`.

`receipt.scanned_artifact_digest` is the selected platform manifest digest, not
the parent image-index digest. Core remains offline: it verifies the receipt
against the retained `oci.manifest.json` bytes and does not fetch registries.
This establishes exact OCI artifact identity only; it does not establish who
published the image or whether the name/digest relationship should be trusted.

## OSV-Scanner

The OSV producer is pinned to OSV-Scanner `v2.5.1`. On Linux CI its release
binary is admitted only when its SHA-256 is
`f9f25499a2c8cc367b3af45df2ea7eeca7fbccceab9c35079968f4b3652194be`.

```bash
python -m src.osv_producer \
  --osv ./osv-scanner \
  --artifact artifacts/requirements.txt \
  --out out-osv
```

OSV writes `osv.raw.json`, `osv.stderr.log`, `evidence.json`, and `receipt.json`.
The exact invocation uses `scan --format json -L <artifact>`. Scanner exit codes
`0` (packages found, no findings) and `1` (findings) are valid result states;
no-package/error states are fail-closed as inconclusive. The adapter requires
every reported source path to bind to the requested artifact, at least one
primary `lockfile` source, and consistency between scanner exit code and raw
vulnerability data.

OSV vulnerability data is queried remotely. The evidence manifest therefore
records `scanner_database.snapshot = "unavailable"` instead of inventing an
immutable database/rule-set identity.

For all modes, `scan_scope` remains `dependency-vulnerabilities`, and
`evidence_digest` binds the retained producer evidence manifest.
